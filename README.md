This report focuses on the development of a character recognition system based on existing artificial classification algorithms. There are three different implementations. The first 
recognizes printed letters and makes use of a Support Vector Machine. The second implementation compares two different algorithms and determines which one is more efficient for identifying handwritten characters. The third and final implementation is a system that recognizes and classifies 
signatures. Each of these implementations was written in 
“python” and tested extensively
